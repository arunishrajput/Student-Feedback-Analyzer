# 🎤 Demo Script – Student Feedback Analyzer

This is a step-by-step flow you can follow while showing your project to teachers.

---

## 1. Introduction (30–40 sec)

> “Good morning everyone, I have built a simple project called **Student Feedback Analyzer**.  
> This project collects student feedback on different subjects, stores it in a MySQL database, and then analyzes it using AI.  
> I’ve used **Streamlit** for the user interface, **MySQL** for storing feedback, and Google’s free **Gemini AI API** for sentiment analysis and summaries.”

---

## 2. Feedback Submission (30 sec)

1. Open **Submit Feedback** page.
2. Enter a sample name, choose a subject, give a rating, and add a comment.
3. Click **Submit**.

Say:

> “Here, the feedback is immediately stored in a **MySQL database.**”

---

## 3. Dashboard (1 min)

1. Switch to the **Dashboard**.
2. Show the **All Feedback Table**.
    > “This shows all the raw data coming directly from MySQL.”
3. Show **Average Ratings per Subject (bar chart)**.
    > “We can see how each subject is rated overall.”

---

## 4. Subject-wise Analysis (1–1.5 min)

1. Use the dropdown to select a subject (e.g., Chemistry).
2. Show **Word Cloud**.
    > “Here’s a word cloud created from student comments. The bigger the word, the more often it appeared.”
3. Show **Sentiment Analysis (AI)**.
    > “The AI model classifies each comment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. This gives a quick sense of overall mood.”
4. Show **AI Summary**.
    > “Finally, the AI generates a short summary of all feedback for this subject. This is useful for teachers to quickly understand what students are saying without reading every comment.”

---

## 5. Conclusion (20–30 sec)

> “So, in summary, this project combines **database management**, **data visualization**, and **artificial intelligence** in one system.  
> It not only collects feedback but also makes it easier to analyze and act on.  
> In the future, I can add features like student login, exporting reports, or comparing subjects over time.”
